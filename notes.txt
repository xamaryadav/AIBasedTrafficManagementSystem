Here's a detailed breakdown of how the signal system works:

1. Signal Timing Structure:
```python
class TrafficSignal:
    def __init__(self, red, yellow, green, minimum, maximum):
        self.red = red          # Red light duration
        self.yellow = yellow    # Yellow light duration (5 seconds default)
        self.green = green      # Green light duration
        self.minimum = minimum  # Minimum green time (10 seconds)
        self.maximum = maximum  # Maximum green time (60 seconds)
```

2. Signal State Progression:
```python
signals = []  # Array of 4 traffic signals
noOfSignals = 4
currentGreen = 0   # Current active green signal (0-3)
currentYellow = 0  # Yellow state flag
nextGreen = (currentGreen + 1) % noOfSignals
```

3. Signal Timing Calculation:
```python
def initialize():
    # First signal starts immediately (green)
    ts1 = TrafficSignal(0, defaultYellow, defaultGreen, defaultMinimum, defaultMaximum)
    
    # Second signal starts after first signal's complete cycle
    ts2 = TrafficSignal(ts1.red + ts1.yellow + ts1.green, 
                      defaultYellow, defaultGreen, 
                      defaultMinimum, defaultMaximum)
    
    # Other signals start on red
    ts3 = TrafficSignal(defaultRed, defaultYellow, defaultGreen, 
                      defaultMinimum, defaultMaximum)
    ts4 = TrafficSignal(defaultRed, defaultYellow, defaultGreen, 
                      defaultMinimum, defaultMaximum)
```

4. Signal Transition Logic:
```python
def repeat():
    global currentGreen, currentYellow, nextGreen
    
    # Green phase
    while signals[currentGreen].green > 0:
        updateValues()
        time.sleep(1)
    
    # Yellow phase
    currentYellow = 1
    while signals[currentGreen].yellow > 0:
        updateValues()
        time.sleep(1)
    currentYellow = 0
    
    # Switch to next signal
    currentGreen = nextGreen
    nextGreen = (currentGreen + 1) % noOfSignals
    
    # Set next signal's red duration
    signals[nextGreen].red = signals[currentGreen].yellow + signals[currentGreen].green
```

5. Timer Updates:
```python
def updateValues():
    for i in range(noOfSignals):
        if i == currentGreen:
            if currentYellow == 0:
                signals[i].green -= 1  # Countdown green
            else:
                signals[i].yellow -= 1 # Countdown yellow
        else:
            signals[i].red -= 1        # Countdown red
```

6. Vehicle Response to Signals:
```python
def move(self):
    # Example for right direction
    if self.direction == 'right':
        can_move = (
            self.crossed == 1 or                    # Already crossed signal
            (currentGreen == 0 and                  # Signal is green
             currentYellow == 0) or                 # Not yellow
            self.x + self.width <= self.stop        # Haven't reached stop line
        )
        if can_move:
            self.x += self.speed
```

7. Signal Display:
```python
# In main loop
for i in range(noOfSignals):
    if i == currentGreen:
        if currentYellow:
            screen.blit(yellowSignal, signalCoods[i])
        else:
            screen.blit(greenSignal, signalCoods[i])
    else:
        screen.blit(redSignal, signalCoods[i])
```

This creates a synchronized traffic management system where:
- Each signal operates on a timer
- Vehicles respond to signal states
- System maintains proper traffic flow
- Signals transition smoothly between states
- Traffic flows in a cyclic pattern



The traffic management system works through these key components:

1. Traffic Signals:
- 4 signals at intersection corners
- Cycles through red, yellow, green states
- Timer-based state changes
- Each signal operates independently

2. Vehicles:
- Spawn randomly from 4 directions
- 5 types: car, bus, truck, rickshaw, bike
- Move based on signal states
- Stop at red lights and maintain safe distances
- Track crossing status

3. Threading:
- Main thread: Handles display/graphics
- Initialization thread: Controls signal timing
- Vehicle generation thread: Creates new vehicles

4. Vehicle Movement:
- Uses coordinate system (x,y)
- Different speeds per vehicle type
- Collision avoidance via gap maintenance
- Stop line detection

5. Display:
- Updates at 60 FPS
- Shows background intersection
- Renders vehicles and signals
- Updates vehicle positions
